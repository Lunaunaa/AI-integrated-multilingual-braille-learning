# PostgreSQL persistence

## Safe schema boundary

The repository did not contain a schema dump or migration history, and this
environment has no `RESONANT_DATABASE_URL`. To avoid changing unknown legacy
tables, Resonant's new tables live under a separate PostgreSQL schema named
`resonant`. The migration does not drop, rename, or alter `public` tables.

The first migration creates:

- `resonant.learners` — UUID learner ID, username, preferred language, and
  creation time.
- `resonant.practice_attempts` — idempotent event records, including correct,
  incorrect, cancelled, accidental-touch, and timeout outcomes.
- `resonant.quiz_results` — idempotent quiz submissions and scores.
- `resonant.skill_progress` — correct-answer counts, mastery estimate, average
  response time, and next review time.
- `resonant.schema_migrations` — applied migration versions.

Migration 002 extends `resonant.learners` with teacher-assisted registration
fields: `name`, `phone`, `email`, `batch`, `consent_at`, `code_hash`, and
`registered_by`.  Partial unique indexes enforce uniqueness for non-NULL
`phone` and `email` while allowing multiple `NULL` values (standard
PostgreSQL behaviour).  The 6-digit learner code is **never stored in
plain text**; only its SHA-256 hash is persisted.  Phone numbers and email
addresses are never written to application logs.

Migration 003 adds the `resonant.teachers` table (`teacher_id`, `name`,
`email`, `password_hash`, `organization`, `created_at`).  A partial unique
index enforces `lower(email)` uniqueness.  A nullable `teacher_id` foreign
key is added to `resonant.learners` to link each learner to their
registering teacher.  Passwords are hashed with bcrypt and are never stored
in plain text or logged.  The column `registered_by` (TEXT, from 002) is
kept as-is for legacy rows; new registrations use the typed `teacher_id` FK.

Migration 004 adds an index on `resonant.learners (teacher_id, created_at DESC)`
to support performant teacher dashboard queries. All learner metrics
(last_active_at, accuracy percentage, 7-day attempt counts, top weak skills,
and activity status) are computed dynamically from `resonant.practice_attempts`
and `resonant.skill_progress`.

Each write uses a psycopg connection context, so the event insert and mastery
update commit or roll back together. Submission UUIDs prevent retries from
creating duplicate attempts or quiz results. Only correct and incorrect
answers affect mastery; interrupted and accidental events remain in history
without being counted as lack of knowledge.

## Configure and migrate

Set `RESONANT_DATABASE_URL` in the backend process environment. Keep real
credentials out of source control and logs. From `resonant_backend`, apply
migrations before starting the API:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:RESONANT_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE"
python migrate.py
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The migration runner takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock and records each
successful version. The SQL is additive and scoped to `resonant`.

## API routes

- `GET /health` checks application availability without touching dependencies.
- `GET /health/database` checks PostgreSQL availability.
- `POST /learners` creates or updates a learner's preferred language.
- `GET /learners/{learner_id}` reads a learner profile.
- `POST /learners/register` — teacher-assisted registration.  **Requires a
  valid teacher `Bearer` token** (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).  Accepts
  `name` (required), `phone` (digits, 7–15 chars), `email`, `batch`,
  `preferred_language`, and `consent` (boolean).  At least one of `phone`
  or `email` is required; `consent` must be `true`.  Stores the registering
  `teacher_id` from the token.  Returns `learner_id` and a one-time
  plaintext `learner_code` (6 digits, hashed before storage).
- `POST /learners/restore` — restore an account on a new device.  Accepts
  `phone_or_email` and the 6-digit `code`.  Returns the learner profile on
  success; 404 if credentials do not match.
- `POST /teachers/signup` — create a teacher account.  Accepts `name`,
  `email`, `password` (min 8 chars), `organization` (optional).  Returns
  the teacher profile; 409 if email already registered.  Passwords are
  bcrypt-hashed and never logged.
- `POST /teachers/login` — verify credentials; return a signed JWT token
  (30-day expiry).  Rate-limited to 10 attempts per email per 10 minutes;
  returns 429 when exceeded.  Returns 401 on wrong credentials.  Emails
  and passwords are never logged.
- `GET /teachers/me/learners` — list this teacher's registered learners
  (id, name, batch, created_at).  Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- `GET /teachers/me/dashboard` — dashboard summary and list of all learners
  belonging to the authenticated teacher. Returns summary metrics (total,
  active this week, struggling count) and per-learner details (id, name,
  batch, last_active_at, current stage/letter, accuracy %, 7-day attempt
  count, top 3 weak letters, status). Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- `GET /teachers/me/learners/{id}` — detailed metrics and recent 50 attempt
  records for a single learner. Includes contact info (phone/email). Returns
  404 if the learner does not exist or belongs to another teacher. Requires
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- `POST /teachers/forgot-password` — generates a 15-minute one-time reset
  token for a registered email. Logs the token to the server console (mock
  email provider). Never logs emails.
- `POST /teachers/reset-password` — verifies the reset token and updates the
  teacher's bcrypt password hash.
- `DELETE /learners/{id}` — permanently removes a learner and cascades to all
  their attempts, quiz results, and skill progress. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  and only allows deleting learners assigned to the calling teacher (404 otherwise).
- `DELETE /teachers/me` — deletes the calling teacher's account. Preserves
  all associated learners and their learning records by setting `teacher_id = NULL`.
  Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- `POST /practice/attempts` records an idempotent practice event and updates
  skill progress for correct/incorrect answers.
- `GET /learners/{learner_id}/progress` reads skill mastery.
- `POST /quizzes/results` records an idempotent quiz result.

Request models validate languages, event types, lengths, score bounds, and
durations. SQL values use parameters. Backend tests mock the database
connection; no PostgreSQL server was available here, so migration execution,
constraints, transaction behavior, and SQL compatibility still require a real
database integration run.

The Flutter app also writes a local JSON event log in application documents
for offline English lesson attempts. It assigns a new UUID to each attempt and
queues pending events locally (`synced_at: null`); when an account is active
and online, pending events are synced idempotently to `/practice/attempts`.

## Privacy limitation

Learner progress and restore endpoints remain unauthenticated.  Teacher
registration (`POST /teachers/signup`, `POST /teachers/login`) and learner
registration (`POST /learners/register`) enforce authentication.  Keep this
API on a trusted local development network. Do not deploy it or use it for
private learner records until all endpoints have authentication and
authorization.

Set `RESONANT_JWT_SECRET` to a long random value in production to sign
teacher tokens.  Tokens have a 30-day expiry and are validated on every
authenticated request.
